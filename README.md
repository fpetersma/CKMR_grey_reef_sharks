# CKMR_grey_reef_sharks

## Introduction

This folder contains all scripts used for a close-kin mark-recapture simulation study. 
These scripts underpin the analysis presented an article currently under review for Ecology and Evolution, and of Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis. 
The study is collaborative effort with Len Thomas, Danielle Harris, Darcy Bradley and Yannis Papastamatiou.

## Overview

This repository contains several folders, only some of which are relevant for the formal analysis. I describe those folders below:
