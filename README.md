# CKMR_grey_reef_sharks

## Introduction

This folder contains all scripts used for a close-kin mark-recapture simulation study. 
These scripts underpin the analysis presented an article currently under review for Ecology and Evolution, and of Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis. 
The study is collaborative effort with Len Thomas, Danielle Harris, Darcy Bradley and Yannis Papastamatiou.

## Overview

This repository contains several folders, only some of which are relevant for the formal analysis. I describe those folders below:
+ data: this data contains 
+ images_no_growth: a folder containing images associated with the results from fitting a model without population growth.
+ images_old_years: a folder with images using an old year structure that is no longer relevant
+ images_with_growth: a folder containing images associated with the results from fitting a model with population growth.
+ reports: a folder containing intermediate analyses and reports as part of the research process.
